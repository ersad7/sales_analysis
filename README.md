# Sales Analysis

**Description:** The aim is to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

We start by cleaning our data, adding new columns, parsing and grouping. Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move to the EDA section for plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:
- Best month for sales, Earnings for that month?
- City with highest product sales
- Time-period to display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customers buying product
- Products most often sold together
- The Most sold Product
